# mmirs_imaging

These are procedures based on Igor Chilingarian's MMIRS reduction pipeline, designed to reduce imaging data, producing
a dark-subtracted, linearity-corrected slope image (in counts per sec). 
The majority of files have only minor fixes or slight modifications relative to Igor's original code.
Therefore prior to copying these procedures, you need to install his software and dependencies.
This code has not been extensively tested, or documented, so use at your own risk.
